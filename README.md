# pygame
Some simple scripts to illustrate game making using pygame

To run these scripts you will need to have a working installation of python with the pygame modules installed. To simplify the installation of pygame it is recomended that you use the [Python 2.7.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/) release with the [pygame 1.9.1](http://www.pygame.org/hifi.html) release.

## Installation

### Windows

It is easiest to use the graphical installers for both Python and pygame. Install Python 2.7.x from [here]((https://www.python.org/downloads/)), and install pygame 1.9.1 from [here](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml).

### Mac OSX

Again, it is easiest to install using the graphical installers for Python 2.7.x from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and pygame 1.9.2 from [here](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml). 

I have seen some graphical library issues with pygame 1.9.2 on El Capitan, if you see these mabe an installation using [homebrew](http://brew.sh/) could be more stable. If so try following [these](http://jalada.co.uk/2011/06/17/installing-pygame-on-os-x-with-a-homebrew-python-2-7-install.html) steps. (First you will need to [install](http://brew.sh/) homebrew.)

## Execution

Once you have Python and pygame installed to run it is as simple as

    python 00-hello_world.py

You can replace <code>00-hello_world.py</code> with the file you wish to run.
